          p.title analysis & risk assessment of existing  wealth structures
          p.regular Analysis and risk assessment is for clients that have an existing structure such as a foundation, trust, insurance wrapâ€¦  Years of experience in performing assessments for clients teaches us that  wealth structures may not be doing what the client believes that the wealth structure should be doing.  In such cases the consequence can be extreme and usually no one thought that it would happen to them.  An independent check of an existing wealth structure is wealth preservation.  An assessment can be focused on one aspect or one particular asset of the structure or it can encompass the entire wealth structure including tax assessment.
          p.title setting up holding structure for personal or business assets
          p.regular A holding structure has benefits to certain individuals and families whether due to tax, logistical complexity or as part of a financial engineering design.  We listen, assess and suggest a plan that is tailored to each individual or family.  Holding structures are an efficient way to manage all assets which helps the client to manage their time more effectively.
